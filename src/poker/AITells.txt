straightens $ dress
adjusts $ tie
wipes $ forehead nervously
scratches $ nose
checks $ watch
adjusts $ glasses
looks up at the ceiling
looks around anxiously
fiddles with $ ring
twitches $ eye
swallows nervously
re-arranges $ cards
tries to not look at anyone directly
hums absent-mindedly
coughs
cracks $ knuckles anxiously
takes a drink from $ glass
checks $ phone
starts sweating
taps $ foot on $ chair
